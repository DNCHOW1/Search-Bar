# Data-Info

## Aggie-Grades
Two csv files related to this are course_classes and rate_my_professor_data. Only missing data I've seen is in rate_my_professor_data with 4 missing entries for firstName.
Some professors in TAMU have not been added to rate my professor as well, so when implementing Search Bar keep this in mind.

course_classes has sections for all courses from past up till Spring 2020. To get data from 2021-2022, must collect data from https://web-as.tamu.edu/gradereport/.

## Car-Data
Data dealing with cars, site has a ton of missing data for some of the fields. Features and types column is a little deceptive, to simplify them I just took the count
of the features and types.

## Roblox_Data
To be added.
