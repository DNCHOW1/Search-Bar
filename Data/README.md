# Data-Info

## Aggie-Grades
Two csv files related to this are course_classes and rate_my_professor_data. Only missing data I've seen is in rate_my_professor_data with 4 missing entries for firstName.
Some professors in TAMU have not been added to rate my professor as well, so when implementing Search Bar keep this in mind.

course_classes has sections for all courses from past up till Spring 2020. To get data from 2021-2022, must collect data from https://web-as.tamu.edu/gradereport/.

## Car-Data
Data dealing with cars, missing a ton of data in some fields (site issue). Features and types column in csv file is a little deceptive, doesn't actually list the many features and types. Instead, to simplify them these two I just took their respective counts.

## Roblox_Data
Decent amount of metrics added for game info. Unsure whether to add each game's description as well as like-dislike ratio for potential features in search bar.
